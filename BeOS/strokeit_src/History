TODO: 
UNDER WAY (1) clean up the interface and make stuff private or protected. 
(2) bug - hiding stroke window by clicking tab losed the window...
(3) the size check needs to be indipendant of the classes. Make both places thet do the if/else
     check, use the same routine...
(4) Add in a floating hint to show the matched char.
(5) Add a 'new file' to the pref.
(6) Add more selections to the pref app.
(7) Tidy up the pref so that it's not monolithic in structure...

1.0.10 20040307/20040308/200403010/200403014/200403016/200403017/200403018
o Got about box to use actual version no read from exe.
o Got settings to store the stroke file to use.
o Added preliminary Mime types for the associated files. Need to set icons etc...
Pref 1.01
o Filled out the pref app. Now has two tabs, a training tab with a stroke window and a initial
   tab which currently needs more work. 
Pref 1.02
o Got pref app to select the file we are using and signal the app with that file. A BMenuFIeld
   gives a ComboBox style selection.
Pref 1.02
o Got pref to accept strokes and save them to the active file (boy was that "fun".)
o Added more stuff to pref and broke it up into seperate files.
Pref 1.03
o As an aside... ported the previous version to PPC when laptop psu was accidentally left at
   work ;-)
Pref 1.04
o Added scale slider to pref. still needs s little work as Be's slider needs to be subclasses to get
   all functionality to work (as in the update of the position's text.. pain!!)
Pref 1.05
o After a false lead (reading and believing Be's docs...) I wasted most of the time today messing
   with slider control descendednts.... just didn't work as they claimed because the routing we are
   meant to override is a const.. DOH! I'm sure if I invested another couple of hours I could research
   the solution, but I really can't be arsed. Instead I've just altered the label (which I thought is what the 
   routine I was overriding was meant to be doing anyway, just aligning right instead) and wrote a 
   function to return the right string.... I could have done that yesterday!!!!!!  


1.09 20040307
o Made strokes load from settings dir by default, but then looks in local dir.
o Added in the 'reload' scripting message.. 
o Started the pref app and got it to signal a reload.

1.08 20040307
o Added settings file using a Be penned class called 'SettingsFile'. I looked at Marcone's Pref class
   (which is basically the exact same idea, but with a server), but decided to not use proprietry, 
  sourceless classes. Saves the scale and the help status.
o Scaling is now implemented including resizeing reletive to the current scale. All seems fone so far,
   though the implementation needs a little clean up (two places use cut/paste of same if/else 
   statement.. bad design!!)

1.07 20040305/20040306
o Found the BBitmapButton experimental source in a Be demo app. Decided to use this over my 
   own code, because it works a lot more nicely.
o Filled out the impl. of the scale. It works for grid, but need to resize controls etc.
o About box now shows nicely.

1.06 20040305
o Struggled with the dubugger, but seem to have cracked the deletion lock up bug for the windows.
   dont seem to hang app anymore.
o Got the about box to appear.

1.05 20040304
o Added bubble help and a menu item to control its use.
o Added a "button" to open the menu in a single click environment.

1.04 20040303
o Now loads strokes from the current path.
o Can't draw outside of the stroke area.
o Made the icon look a bit more professional - use same icon for the Summon window.
o Added provisions for scaling the window.

1.03 20040301
o Altered the summon window so that it stays on top of all windows. 
o  Added an image to the summon window. 
o Fixed the buttons to send keycodes for the non ascii keys that previously worked flakily (DELete    
   and RETurn)
o Added code to handle screen resizing. Will auto move the Summon window to the bottom right if the 
   screen resolution changes.
o Added a popup menu. 
o Added a 'quit' item to the popup menu.
o Added a 'snap' popup menu item to snap the stroke window to the home position. 
o Added code to force the Stroke window to a 'home' position (right most edge of screen, directly 
   abobe the summon window..)
       
1.02 : 20040229 / 20040301
Revised the source layout so that everything is not in a single file (it was a big hack originally....!)
Added in the initial 'summon' functionality. User can show/hide stroke window with a mouse click.

Tracked down the file read bug; added an EOF style marker "0=0" to help knowing when we hit it. There's still a crash bug if there are a lot of blank lines after the strokes, but the EOF is now a *required* feature until further notice.

Altered the window look and feel, removed all the controls from the floating window. Unfortunately this means there's no was to close it... will fix this in next version ;-=)

1.01 : 20040226
Added "space", "del" and "return" keys. Altered start up position so that it appears in the bottom left
of a 800x600 screen.

1.00 : 20040225
Added support for "modes". Both a "caps" mode and a "numeric" mode. Reduced resolution from 300 pixels wide to 150pixels to make it look more reasonable of a 800x600 screen.

N/A : 20040224
Basic implementation. Strokes work, but there is no way of entering non ascii strokes or numerals.
