This is a bunch of software I've written over the years. Some of it has been "saved" from legacy hard disks (so the dates are a little screwy.)

Highlights are 

* StrokeIt - input driver for BeOS R5 for PalmPilot style text entry
* DoodUrls - a iPhone App I once published (circa 2009/2010)
* MvcFramework[40/45] - 3 different versions of an MVC alike framework for Windows.Forms
* pricingbasket - a task I once got given in a pre-interview (seriously!!)
* ratcowUI - messing about with making a custom UI
* delphi - I was once a Delphi developer... and here is some stuff I wrote
* comicbookreader - a little port of the ComicBookLover ComicBookInfo JSON API
* simpleelectronicsui - I found this today and had forgotten all about it. A little Arduino-ish thing for making Sketche style apps in C#.

The rest is no less notable, but come of it is a bit boring...

* ratcowutilities - a load of stuff, including some banking/BACS validation that is probably so specific no one will ever need it.
* outliner - a little outliner I wrote in an hour to scratch an itch
* PDF exploration - app I made to re-order PDF files in to a booklet.. used this when I used to self publish comic books.

Some of the rest is hald baked.
